Drawing on Skellam's (1958) work on sampling animal populations using transects, we derive a behavioral ecological model of the choice between sit-and-wait and active-search hunting. Using simple, biologically-based, assumptions about the characteristics of predator and prey, we show how an empirically definable parameter space favoring active-search hunting expands as: 1) the average rate of movement of a prey species decreases, or 2) the energetic cost of hunter locomotion declines. On the other hand, the parameter space favoring active-search declines as: 3) prey skittishness increases (as a function of the hunter's velocity), or 4) prey become less detectable as the hunter's velocity increases. Additionally, we investigate the role of habitat heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation (grouping) in prey movement on the search strategy of a hunter, finding that habitat heterogeneity has the potential to complicate application of the model to some empirical examples, while the effects of prey grouping lead to relatively similar model outcomes. We use case studies of bison hunting on the Great Plains and Arctic big game hunting to evaluate a key prediction of our model, that a decrease in the metabolic cost of active-search will favor its use. As predicted by the model, the introduction of the horse to the Great Plains and the introduction of the snowmobile to Arctic foraging communities, radically changed normative hunting strategies to favor active-search hunting in place of sit-and-wait hunting.
