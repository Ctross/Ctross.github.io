## I got inspired by...

Richard Feynman and his beautiful way of looking at the world through the eyes of a scientist, as demonstrated in his disscusion [Fun to Imagine][1], when I was young.  Feynman's way of seeing the world left me with a deep appreciation of the wonder and joy of existence, and the pleasure of thinking, learning, and imagining.  

Please make *Feeling Responsive* yours and if you like it, please link back to my homebase <a href="http://phlow.de/">Phlow</a>. That would be awesome.

#### Since then, fork it!

Yours sincerelly, [Moritz »mo.« Sauer][2]
