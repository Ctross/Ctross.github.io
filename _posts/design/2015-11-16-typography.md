In the small world of a simple mathematical model, revolutions always start from the actions of two classes of people: those who have so much privellege that the cost of a failed revolution are negligible, and those who so underpriveledged that all-or-nothing is a surivival mechanism, even when the odd of failure are astronomical. 

To begin, lets assume a couple facts about how revolutions happen. First, let us assume that the probability of a successful revolution, **p**, is a function of the number of pledged revolutionaries, **R**. In the context of #BernieOrBust, let this be the number of people who will either vote green, write Bernie in, or just sit at home, rather than vote Clinton. If, by some fantanistical stroke of genius, all Bernie supporters could coordinate and agree to not vote Clinton in the main election, such a threat would likely be enough to sway the unpledged delagates to vote Bernie at the Democratic convention (Really we should only need 10-20 percent of Bernie supporter to make such a pledge, in order for loss of democratic votes to be suffcient to exceed Hilary's projected margin over Trump... but I'll leave the numbers math to someone else). The only problem here is getting such a massive number of people to coordinate, and do so in a way that is convincing enough to carry poltical weight. #BernieOrBust, of course, is an attempt at implementing such a coordinated effort, but one that is currently unlike to achieve much. Why? To answer that question, lets turn to the next assumptions our model.

Let us assume that there is some cost, **c**, if a revolution fails, and some benefit, **B**, if the revolution succeeds. Finally, let us assume that individuals in the society are heterogeneous in terms of how much privilege, **Q**, they have. Lets declare that there is some level of privilege, **Q'** below which people will do anything to avoid falling. Lets say that rich, white, young, male progressives have a lot of **Q**, so much so that even if the revolution fails and the pay the cost of failure, **c**, they are really not much worse off. **Q-c** is still a ton of privilege. Lets also note that some people might have so little **Q** that they are below **Q'**, so they can only reach **Q** by gaining *B* from a successfull revolution.

So when people talk about #BernieOrBust "throwing underprivileged people under the bus", they should be more clear. If #BernieOrBust fails, then yes a lot of people will suffer from it, especially people with **Q<Q'+c**. But, if #BernieOrBust isn't tried, then we are throwing all of those people with **Q<Q'** under the bus, and these people, by definition, are more underpriviledged. 

Before I gave #BernieOrBust a lot of critical thought, I was #BernieOrBust all the way. I am also a finacially-stable (sort of), white, young, male progressive, and I was driven by the hope of achieving something great (seeing a president like Bernie in my lifetime); I didn't really take the time to consider the consequences of #BernieOrBust failing, becuase to me those consequnces are for the most part inconsequential (this is being blind to priviledge, and this was ignorant of me). I was thinking of those with **Q<Q'**, maybe people with family in Palestine that are horrified by Clinton's APIC speech, but I didn't give enough thought about how to protect those with **Q<Q'+c** from consequnces if #BernieOrBust doesn't work.
