In the small world of a simple mathematical model, revolutions always start from the actions of two classes of people: those who have so much privilege that the cost of a failed revolution are negligible, and those who are so underprivileged that all-or-nothing is a survival mechanism, even when the odds of failure are astronomical. 

To begin, let's assume a few facts about how revolutions like #BernieOrBust happen. First, let us assume that the probability of a successful revolution, **p**, is a function of the number of pledged supporters, **R**. In the context of #BernieOrBust, let this be the number of people who will either vote green, write-in Bernie, or just sit at home, rather than vote Clinton. If, by some fantastical stroke of genius, all Bernie supporters could coordinate and agree to not vote Clinton in the main election, such a threat would likely be enough to sway the unpledged delegates to vote Bernie at the contested Democratic convention (really, we should only need 10-15 percent of Bernie supporter to make such a pledge, in order for the projected loss of democratic votes to be sufficient to exceed Hilary's projected margin over Trump... but I'll leave the numbers to someone else). The problem here is getting such a massive number of people to coordinate, and do so in a way that is convincing enough to carry political weight. #BernieOrBust, of course, is an attempt at implementing such a coordinated effort, but one that is currently unlike to achieve much. Why? To answer that question, let's turn to the next assumptions our model.

<div class="medium-8 columns t30">

    </div><!-- /.medium-8.columns -->
    
Let us assume that there is some cost, **c**, if a revolution fails, and some benefit, **B**, if the revolution succeeds. Finally, let us assume that individuals in the society are heterogeneous in terms of how much privilege, **Q**, they have, and declare that there is some level of privilege, **Q'** below which people will do anything to avoid falling. Let's say that rich, white, young, male progressives have a lot of **Q**, so much so that even if the revolution fails and the pay the cost of failure, **c**, they are really not much worse off ([Link 1][1]). **Q-c** is still a ton of privilege. Lets also note that some people might have so little **Q** that they are below **Q'**, so they can only reach **Q** by gaining **B** from a successful revolution ([Link 2][2]).

So when people ([Link 1][1]) talk about #BernieOrBust "throwing underprivileged people under the bus", they should really be more clear (and maybe avoid leaning on monolithic narratives that erase the diverse voices of Bernie supporters). If #BernieOrBust fails, then yes a lot of people will suffer from it, especially people with **Q** such that **Q'+c>Q>Q'**. But, if #BernieOrBust isn't tried, then we are throwing all of those people with **Q<Q'** under the bus, and these people, by definition, are *more* underprivileged. 

Before I gave #BernieOrBust a lot of critical thought, I was #BernieOrBust all the way. I am also a financially-stable (sort of), white, young, male progressive, and I was driven to support #BernieOrBust by anger at how the cards were being stacked against a progressive Democrate, but I didn't give enough thought about how #BernieOrBust could be re-imagined to protect those with **Q'+c>Q>Q'** from consequences if #BernieOrBust doesn't work.

To figure out how to build a better #BernieOrBust, let's think about the dynamics of a #BernieOrBust revolution:

1) Those severely underprivileged with **Q<Q'** and their very privileged allies with **Q>>Q'+c** declare that they are #BernieOrBust.
2) The rest of the population is then forced into some calculus... To join the revolution, or to oppose/ignore it. A given person might look at their own state **Q**, and then ask the question: given the number of current revolutionaries, and thus probability of a successful revolution, should I join the revolution? In other words is the possible gain of **pB** (if the revolution succeeds) worth risking the loss **(1-p)c** if it fails?
3) As more people join the revolution, **p** increases, and in doing so it further incentivizes others to join the revolution, by increasing the expected gain term and decreasing the expected loss term. 
4) From here, three things can happen. i) #BernieOrBust fizzles out before it grows popular enough to make any significant difference in voter outcomes (the BAD). ii) #BernieOrBust grows barley big enough to split the Democratic vote, so it is ignored by the Democratic establishment, and Trump wins, (the UGLY). Or, iii) #BernieOrBust grows huge, and leads to Bernie winning a challenged convention (the GOOD). It should be noted, that as it stands: the BAD is likely, the UGLY is unlikely but possible, and the GOOD is a fantasy.
5) The issue is that in a population like the United States, with a massively skewed privilege distribution, we find that we get to a point where a great majority of the people just are not willing to risk #BernieOrBust, because the cost of failure for them is just too extreme. This is the range of Bernie supporters with **Q** such that the cost of failure of #BernieOrBust would lead to an unacceptable situation, **Q-(1-p)c<Q'**, for the current **p**. For a lot of people, **c**=Trump is too scary to fuck with regeardless of **B*.

While the above may seem disheartening, there is a way to do better than #BernieOrBust, which I have called unimaginatively #ABetterBernieOrBust.

Let's list a few goals:
1) We do not throw the severely underprivileged, **Q<Q'**, under the bus.
2) We do not throw the underprivileged,**Q'+c>Q>Q'**, under the bus.
3) We maximize the attractiveness of #BernieOrBust to Clinton-tolerant, Bernie-supporting moderates, who have zero tolerance for risk of suffering **c**.

The #ABetterBernieOrBust pledge:
1) If the percentage of #ABetterBernieOrBust pledgers among likely Democratic voter exceeds Clinton's projected margin of victory in the main election versus Trump, I pledge to #BernieOrBust and vote Green or write-in Bernie.
2) If the percentage of #ABetterBernieOrBust pledgers among likely Democratic voter does not exceed Clintons projected margin of victory in the main election versus Trump, I pledge to vote Clinton in the main election.

The #ABetterBernieOrBust pledge draws on the same principle for organizing coordination that lets things like Kickstarter work. We know ahead of time that a sufficient level of investment is needed to make a project feasible, and any investment in that project is wasted unless total investment from other donors reaches a critical threshold. This frequency-dependent feedback stops small investments from accumulating, because the initial investments are very risky bets. However, by forming a collective agreement prior to investment, that funds will only be dispersed if the targeted funding goal is reached, destructive frequency-dependent feedback is cut-off and a mutually beneficial coordination is easily generated.

In the case of #ABetterBernieOrBust, the first part of the pledge means that we fight with everything we have to not throw the severely underprivileged, **Q<Q'**, under the bus; we aim to make the Democratic party progressive, something other than Republican-light. The second part means, we build in a fail-safe to avoid throwing the underprivileged,**Q'+c>Q>Q'**, under the bus. This two part pledge should also make #ABetterBernieOrBust much more palatable to moderates than #BernieOrBust, increasing the likelihood of us being able to build a critical mass of supporters to make it work.

If anyone out there in this wide internet likes the sound of this idea, share this post, revise my crappy style of writing, develop the mathematical model (which is nothing more than a sketch at the moment), spread the word, and maybe together we can organize a secure, robust, platform to organize our collective action.
