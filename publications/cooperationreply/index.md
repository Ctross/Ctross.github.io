The main objective of our target article was to sketch the empirical case for the importance of selection at the level of
groups on cultural variation. Such variation is massive in humans, but modest or absent in other species. Group selection
processes acting on this variation is a framework for developing explanations  of  the  unusual  level  of  cooperation  between
non-relatives found in our species. Our case for cultural group selection (CGS) followed Darwin’s classic syllogism regarding
natural selection: If variation exists at the level of groups, if this variation is heritable, and if it plays a role in the success or
failure of competing groups, then selection will operate at the level of groups. We outlined the relevant domains where such
evidence can be sought and characterized the main conclusions of work in those domains. Most commentators agree that CGS
plays some role in human evolution, although some were considerably  more  skeptical.  Some  contributed  additional
empirical cases. Some raised issues of the scope of CGS explanations versus competing ones.
