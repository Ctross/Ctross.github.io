In this dissertation, I explore the use of Bayesian models and Hamiltonian Markov Chain
Monte Carlo methods in the analysis of data relevant to applied anthropological and
human behavioral ecological studies. The anthropological data in such studies are often
incomplete, censored, or uncertain, limiting the usefulness of both the data itself and
standard statistical tools. However, recent advances in Bayesian model specification
and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo parameter estimation methods allow for integration over
uncertainty due to missing, censored, and partially known data, and can thus dramatically
improve the quality of analysis in pure and applied anthropological studies.
The first chapter in this dissertation uses a multi-level Bayesian survival analysis model
and a Gamma-Poisson Bayesian network to analyze spatial and temporal patterns in
life-history trade-offs in the Agta. The second chapter uses a Bayesian Ornstein{Uhlenbeck
process-based adaptive phylogenetic model to investigate the relationship between stratification
and the evolutionary origins of female genital modification in Africa. The third
chapter uses Bayesian methods to investigate the cultural evolutionary dynamics of the
transmission and maintenance/attenuation of female genital modification in a case study of
the African diaspora and indigenous populations of Colombia.
