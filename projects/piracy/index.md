This paper seeks to supplement qualitative descriptions for the roots causes of Somali piracy, with explicit mathematical models for human behavior, derived from evolutionary theory. Human behavioral ecological modeling can explain the rise and persistence of Somali piracy in the context of illegal fishing pressure. The subsistence strategies of piracy and fishing are modeled as having density-dependent return rates; a z-score model of risk-sensitive subsistence is used to assess which of the two strategies should be pursued by a rational-actor conditional on illegal fishing pressure and the number of pirates and fishermen in the population. Our model shows that once piracy becomes established in a population due to illegal fishing pressure, neither the reduction of illegal fishing pressure alone, nor the incarceration of pirates alone, will be sufficient to eliminate piracy. 

Paper coming soon.
