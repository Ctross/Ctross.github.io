Recently, Beheim et al. [1] introduced the idea of using archived records
of movement patterns in the game of Go to study the cultural evolutionary
dynamics of gaming strategy. Until the introduction of this approach, evidence
for cultural evolution was based primarily on mathematical models
[2, 3], simulation [4], short-term experimental evidence [5, 6, 7], and verbal
arguments [8, 9]. Quantitative analysis of cultural evolution through
social and prestige-biased learning in natural environments was hampered
by the lack of nely-resolved, individual-level data on human behavior over
long courses of time. Interestingly, strategy games such as Go and Chess
have risen to such a level of cultural importance, that the project of voluntarily
recording massive amounts of longitudinal data has been completed
already by game acionados. These data permit the application of annuallyresolved
time-series analysis to the evolutionary dynamics of game playing
behavior, and allow for the eects of individual learning, social learning, and
prestige-biased learning to be analyzed in a unied framework. This paper
will examine evidence regarding the use of these learning strategies in the
selection of Chess opening moves, over the period of time from 1975 to 2013,
in a data set containing over 1.1 million games played by more than 54,000
professional Chess players.
