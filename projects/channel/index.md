In this paper, we aim to further the Winterhalder et al (2010) analysis (see also Jazwa et al, 2013) by using spatially explicit models to estimate the linkages between settlement timing and ecological suitability, while simultaneously estimating and controlling for the eects of previously unmodeled spatial processes. Several important questions remain unanswered concerning the structuring of settlement on the NCIs; for instance, independent of habitat suitability do established settlements exhibit a 'push' or 'pull' on subsequent settlement in nearby locations? Is there evidence of island-to-island patterning, where sub-optimal locations on an already colonized island are settled before more suitable locations on distant islands?

Paper coming soon.
